🤖 Hi, I'm Tarun Dande!
MSc in AI & Machine Learning | University of Limerick 🇮🇪

I’m a specialized AI Developer who transitioned from "making models" to "building agents that do the work for me." I combine my academic rigor from UL with a hands-on obsession for autonomous systems.

🛠️ What I’m up to
Current Focus: Architecting AI Agents and multi-agent workflows.

Skilling Up: Mastering Agentic Design Patterns (Planning, Tool Use, and Reflection).

Building: End-to-end projects that move beyond simple chat to actual task execution.

🧰 The Toolkit
Languages: Python (Primary), SQL

Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

AI/ML Concepts: Neural Networks, NLP, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and LLM Orchestration.

Agent Tools: LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI (or any you are currently exploring).

📈 Looking for Opportunities
I am actively seeking roles as an ML Engineer, AI Developer, or Data Scientist where I can deploy agentic solutions to solve real-world problems.
